# OpenCV C++: Pupil detection,Camera Calibration 
## I make use of OpenCV in C++ with Visual studio 2012 to achieve the following image processing:
## 1. Camera Calibration
- ### 1.1 Corner detection 
- ### 1.2 Find the intrinsic matrix 
- ### 1.3 Find the extrinsic matrix 
- ### 1.4 Find the distortion matrix  
## 2. Pupil detection    
   - ### 2.1 Median Smooth  去除圖片的雜訊 
   - ### 2.2 Canny  邊緣偵測 
   - ### 2.3 HoughCircle + cvCircle  找出圓並將瞳孔標示出來 



   
## For the details of each image processing result, please refer to the PPT,"OpenCV image processing request" in the repo.
## Requirement:
- ### Visual Studio 2012
- ### OpenCV 2.4.7 or above.
## For the complete project,which includes all the programs and images used to implement the image processing feature mentioned above, please download it with this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/122HTNpz-vxVXkmRNVxtYO-x0qc3-SHqb/view?usp=sharing)
