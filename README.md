# OpenCV_ImageProcessing
## I make use of OpenCV in C++ with Visual studio 2012 to achieve the following image processing:
## 1.  SIFT
## 2.  Background Subtraction
## 3.  Optical Flow tracking
   - ### 3.1 Preprocessing 
   - ### 3.2 Tracking whole video 
## 4. Face Recognition & Detection 
   - ### 4.1 Face Recognition 
   - ### 4.2 Face Detection 
   - ### 4.3 Face Detection + Recognition 
   
## For the details of each image processing result, please refer to the PPT,"OpenCV image processing request" in the repo.
## For the complete project,which includes all the programs and images used to implement the image processing feature mentioned above, please download it with this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J-WrxQHtTqhORK4FZDjrPSpzvIaWOrIY/view?usp=sharing)
